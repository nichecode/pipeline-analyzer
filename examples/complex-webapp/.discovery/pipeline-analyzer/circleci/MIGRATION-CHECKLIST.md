# CircleCI ‚Üí go-task Migration Checklist

**Generated:** 2025-08-21T07:59:05+01:00

## üéØ Migration Overview

This checklist guides you through converting your CircleCI configuration to a local go-task setup.

### üìä Current State

- **13 jobs** to migrate
- **3 workflows** to understand
- **13 jobs** use Docker
- **0 jobs** use other executors

## üîÑ Migration Steps

### 1. **Understand job dependencies**
Review [Job Usage Analysis](summaries/job-usage.md) to see which jobs depend on others.

### 2. **Examine Docker images and executors**
Check [Docker & Scripts](summaries/docker-and-scripts.md) for container requirements.

### 3. **Analyze command patterns**
Study [Commands Analysis](summaries/commands.md) to understand build patterns.

### 4. **Start with high-impact jobs**
Begin with the most frequently used jobs from the overview.

### 5. **Convert commands to go-task**
Transform run commands to task format - see individual job files.

### 6. **Test task equivalents** locally

## Key Files to Examine

- [Job Usage Analysis](summaries/job-usage.md) - How jobs are reused and their dependencies
- [All Jobs](summaries/all-jobs.md) - Complete job list with descriptions
- [Docker & Scripts](summaries/docker-and-scripts.md) - Docker/script patterns
- [Workflows](summaries/workflows.md) - Workflow structure and job orchestration
